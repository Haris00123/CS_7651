#Code Repository Linke
Please see code, pdf, and datasets at https://gatech.box.com/s/7owrxwjfdmbc6fn3sat93qjkvmqghrul
#Installation

Please use Python 3.8.18. I have added a requirements.txt file in the box folder that contains all the packages I have used. 
The main packages were matplotlib, panadas, numpy, keras, scipy, KModes and sklearn. 

#Running Instructions

Each pf the different sections of the assignment have their own Jupyter file, Namely: 
- Phase 1 is clustering and dimensionality reduction. 
- Phase 2-1 is clustering on DR dataset for FMINST. 
- Phase 2-2 is clustering on DR dataset for Heart.
- Phase 3 is Neural Network for DR'd data.
- Phase 4 is Neural Network for clustered data. 
The main code for the neural network section can be found in NNnet_training.py
Please be sure to add NNnet_Support.py and A3_utils.py in the same folder (they have utility functions)
