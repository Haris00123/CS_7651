Please use Python 3.8.18. I have added a requirements.txt file in the box folder that contains all the packages I have used. 
The main packages were matplotlib, panadas, numpy, keras, scipy and sklearn. 

#Running Instructions

The main code for the assignment (creating the plots, hyperparameter tuning, final scoring, etc.) can all be found in the Assignment_1_code file.
Please ensure that you also download the NNnet_class file as that file contains my class for the kears neural network.
