#Code Repository Linke
Please see code, pdf, and datasets at https://gatech.box.com/s/pa1w2erkqiruyi95zfomgqgqqig97ad7
#Installation

Please use Python 3.8.18. I have added a requirements.txt file in the box folder that contains all the packages I have used. 
The main packages were matplotlib, panadas, numpy, scipy, openaigym and bettermdptools. 

#Running Instructions

There are two folders in box, one for Blackjack and the second for Frozenlake, each with their own complement of openaigym and bettermdptools. 
It's important to install their respective packages as I worked off of two computers during this assignment and made source codes changes specific in these libraries specific
to each problem.
