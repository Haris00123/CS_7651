#Code Repository Linke
Please see code, pdf, and datasets at : https://gatech.box.com/s/t1dlus9aysogqzp5esjd0viag56ouiiz
#Installation

Please use Python 3.8.18. I have added a requirements.txt file in the box folder that contains all the packages I have used. 
The main packages were matplotlib, panadas, numpy, keras, scipy, mlrose and sklearn. 

#Running Instructions

The main code for the optimization algorithms section can be found in optimization_algos.py.
The main code for the neural network section can be found in NNnet_training.pyt, please be sure to add NNnet_Support.py in the same folder (it has utility functions)
Finally, please be sure to pip install -e the mlrose folder contained within the submission folder on box, as that is needed to run the code. I made some changes on the library to complete my assignment.
